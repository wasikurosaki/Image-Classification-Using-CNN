# Image-Classification-Using-CNN
The model has ben run on the CIFER10 DATASET.

aT FIRST I have used ann TO CLASSIFY THE IMAGES. After that I have used CNN to complete the same task. With the classifier report we can eeasily say that CNN works better in cases to images than ANN.

In my model archetecture, I have used 32 features in my first @D layer and add a MaxPooling of 2X2. In the second @d layer I have again used 32 layers and a maxpooling of 2X2. Then I used a dense layer with flatenning layer.
For faster training I have only used 5 epochs.


# The Accuracy of the model is 67%
